A formal naming ceremony will take place in the coming weeks. - Speaking about the naming, Mayor of the City of Galway, Cllr Eddie Hoare commented, “The River Corrib has seen its share of people, young and old, who are suffering or have lost hope. For all those who have concerns about mental health – your own, or your loved ones - the new bridge name, Droichead an D?chais, reminds us that there is always hope. For our young people especially, we want them to have hope for the future – for their future. The proposed name reflects positive action, at a time when Climate Change is an ever-present crisis - as the new pedestrian and cycle bridge makes connections for those on foot, wheeling or cycling. As we cross over three waterways on the new bridge, we connect with our fellow Galwegians and those visiting our city too. In times when conflict and unrest are frequent headlines, Droichead an D?chais also reflects our hope for peace, and an end to the trauma and destruction that ordinary people are living with around the world. Ireland knew war and conflict in the past too, with the new name a reflection on the importance of peace and reconciliation. Finally, the name proposed is “as Gaeilge”, reflecting our proud status as a bilingual City.” - The public were invited to make suggestions for the new bridge name from late December 2023 until 6pm on Sunday 11 February 2024. The Civic Naming Committee reviewed all proposals, in relation to the Civic Naming Protocol, and agreed unanimously to recommend ‘Droichead an D?chais’ for consideration of the Corporate Policy Group and Council Members. - The public submissions proposing D?chas/ Hope said the name was, “…hope for the future. In this time of challenging climate change, Galway has put in place a solid, tangible structure to enable people to use their cars less, and walk across a beautiful river, experiencing the view, the wildlife, the fresh air…”. They also said, “…due to the amount of suicide cases can we call the bridge The Bridge of Hope…”, and “…I would like the new bridge to be named HOPE. For everyone who needs it. It helps everyone cross a river and it provides safety and strength”. - Galway City Council wishes to acknowledge the people and groups who took the time to make submissions for the naming of this significant piece of infrastructure for the people of Galway. The creativity, thought, and consideration expressed by those making submissions was greatly appreciated. There are submissions that the Civic Naming Committee will consider for other/ future commemorations, as there were several people whose service or contribution to life in Galway City were noteworthy and could be recognised in other locations/ commemorations.  - Droichead an D?chais opened in May 2023, creating a new public space for locals and tourists alike to cross over three watercourses, while taking in the wildlife, natural and built heritage around them.

8;City Hall Welcomes Helium Arts: Celebrating Youth Empowerment Through Art;The Mayor of the City of Galway, Cllr Eddie Hoare, welcomed practitioners and young people involved in Helium Arts to City Hall last week, in recognition of the valuable work of the group. Helium Arts is an award-winning children’s arts and health charity that aims to improve the personal, health and social outcomes of children and young people with lifelong physical health conditions by providing opportunities for creativity and connection that they may not otherwise have access to. Through a series of arts-based workshops, they create safe and inclusive spaces that inspire creativity, spark friendships, and improve mental health and well-being. Five young people, ages 6-16, and their families met with Mayor Hoare to showcase some of their work, and to speak about the impact of their participation in the Helium Arts programmes in Galway. The charity hosts workshops across various locations in Galway, including the Westside Library, GRETB FET Centre in Athenry, and the Loughrea Family Resource Centre. - Speaking about the reception, Mayor Hoare commented, “I’m delighted to welcome the children, young people, families and practitioners involved in Helium Arts. The children and young people in City Hall this afternoon are showing us a small flavour of the brilliance, creativity and imagination they possess. Creativity gives children – and adults – opportunities to try out new ideas, new ways of thinking and problem solving – with the added bonus of producing some new spectacular for the eyes, the ears and the senses. We are all natural explorers – it’s how babies and young children discover their world, make connections and make sense of the world. These children and young people remind us how important it is to continue to unlock our natural curiosity and sense of experimentation – to build community, spark friendships, reveal new skills and interests, and empower young people to overcome adversity. I want to congratulate you all for challenging yourself to participate in the Helium Arts programmes, and for producing such spectacular results”. - The Mayor also acknowledged the work of the artists and volunteers in Helium Arts, whose skills, technical expertise and time are crucial to draw out the talents of the children and young people, and to support them on their journey of self-discovery and resilience building. - Helium Arts supports children and young people living with lifelong health conditions including diabetes, epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, allergies, heart conditions, asthma, spina bifida, juvenile arthritis, rare or complex conditions and many more. - Helene Hugel, CEO and Artistic Director for Helium Arts said, “In Ireland, 13% (136,000) of children live with the challenges of a lifelong health condition. 18,000 of these children are considered as severely hampered in their everyday lives. Research shows that young people living with health conditions face loneliness, stress, anxiety, and can feel defined by their condition. They experience stigma associated with their condition, social isolation and loneliness and fewer quality friendships. - At Helium Arts, we're committed to addressing these challenges year-round. Our community workshops serve as safe and accessible spaces where children navigating health conditions can come together. Here, they have the opportunity to connect, forge friendships and unlock their potential by discovering new skills and interests.  We believe that creativity can empower young people to feel confident, worthwhile and respected and this helps them to become more prepared and capable in daily life. - According to a recent independent evaluation of our community programme, 100% of parents reported that their child experienced an improved quality of life after participating in Helium Arts workshops. This is a testament to the positive impact of our work on the lives of these young individuals and their families.” - Children and young people interested in participating in a Helium Arts event – online, or in person - can find details of events taking place nationwide on https://Helium.ie/Workshops/ - Upcoming Galway City events include ‘Galway Spring Saturdays’ for ages 8-12, and ‘Galway Saturday Meet Ups’, for ages 13-16.;19/4/2024;https://www.galwaycity.ie/news/3691/59/City-Hall-Welcomes-Helium-Arts-Celebrating-Youth-Empowerment-Through-Art-/d,NewsDetail;"["Your Council"]"

14; Possibility of Coastal Flooding due to Unusually High Tides;We are in a period of very high spring tides and are entering a generally unsettled spell of wet and windy weather. Coastal flooding is possible due to unusually high tides. Surge levels are expected to increase through the week in association with a low-pressure system which tracks along the west coast. Winds will also pick up and strengthen as this system passes. A High Tide Advisory (HTA) has been issued and extends until Wednesday 13 March (PM High Tide) for all coasts. It is important to note that the time of high tide will coincide with elevated surge and moderate to strong onshore winds right along the Atlantic coast over the coming days. Possible Road Closure: Galway City Council Crews will be on hand monitoring a possible Road Closure from the mini-roundabout at Salthill Upper/Threadneedle Road along Seapoint Promenade as far as Galway Business School during this period. Car Parks: Toft Car Park will be closed off to the public until further notice, Silverstrand Road will be closed off to the public until further notice, Ballyloughane Beach Road will be for local access only until further notice. ;11/3/2024;https://www.galwaycity.ie/news/3688/59/Possibility;"["Environment"]"
15; Public Consultation - Clifden Railway Pedestrian and Cycle Bridge;Galway City Council is seeking feedback from the public on the proposed new Clifden Railway Bridge Pedestrian and Cycle Bridge. The proposed bridge will use the abutments of the former Clifden Railway Bridge, which remain visible in the River Corrib today, and will link the Dyke Road area with the University of Galway campus. The reinstatement of the bridge as a pedestrian and cycle link will connect places of study, work, retail, and recreation using sustainable modes of transport. The bridge will help to bring a vibrancy and rejuvenation to the surrounding areas, creating new places of public realm. Following an options assessment of the project, an emerging preferred option for the design of the bridge has been identified.  This design, along with two alternative options, can be seen in an information brochure and in technical drawings which are available at this link. Galway City Council is also inviting people to have their say on the project and the designs by completing a short survey which is available at this link.  The deadline to complete this survey is 5pm on Thursday, April 11th. Feedback from all prospective users of the bridge is welcome and will inform the next steps of this project.;11/3/2024;https://www.galwaycity.ie/news/3688/59/Public;"["Your Council"]"
